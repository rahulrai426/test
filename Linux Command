chmod o-x /opt/devopsdir/. this is for remove excutable permission from other user
chmod o-r /opt/devopsdir/. this is for remove write permission from other user

file system of linux

Some Important Directions 

Home Directories : /root , /home/username
User Executable : /bin , /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin
System Excutable : /sbin , /usr/sbin, /usr/local/sbin
Other mountPoints : /media , /mnt
Configuration : /etc
Temporary Files : /tmp
Kernels and Bootloader : /boot
Server Data : /var , /srv
System information : /proc , /sys
Shared Libraries : /lib , /usr/lib , /usr/local/lib


File information

r => read
w => write
x => excute permission

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   18 Apr 11 01:39 cmds -> /root/ops/text.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 10 19:16 devops
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 11 01:39 ops
drwx------ 3 root root 4096 Apr  6 11:06 snap
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    9 Apr 10 19:17 text.txt

first is =>filetype

rw- next three is => user
next three  for group 
last three for others

ls -ld /opt/devopsdir permission checking

chown ansible:devops /opt/devopsdir/. change the ownership for directory. and we can use chown -R for all the file or directory

chmod o-x /opt/devopsdir/. this is for remove excutable permission from other user
chmod o-r /opt/devopsdir/. this is for remove write permission from other user
chmod g+w /opt/devopsdir/. this is for add write permission to group 



Redirection file
date > /tmp/sys.txt : save output in any path
echo '===================================â€˜ >>/tmp/sys.txt double symbol use for add text and out in redirection file




Users & groups

1. root   Home directory = /root  shell = /bin/bash
2. Regular user =  insta home directory = /home/username shell = /bin/bash
3. service ftp, ssh home directory  = /var/ftp etc shell = /sbin/nologin

User creation

1. username = useradd username. and useradd -m jenkins(this is with home directory)
2. Group = groupadd group name
3. add to new group  = usermod -aG devops ramesh
4. change and assign the password to user = passwd ramesh 
5. switch user : sudo su -p aws
6. give to sudo access to user : sudo usermod -aG sudo aws
7. this is check what activity done by user:  lsof -u insta
8. Del user : userdel aws and if you want to remove home directory also use userdel -r username
9. group del : groupdel group name



Viewing Permissions from the command - line

1. File permission may be viewed using ls -l. : ls -l /bin/login
